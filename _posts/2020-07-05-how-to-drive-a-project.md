# Project Lifecycle

## Identifying a problem

- Find needs within the team or the org.
    - How can I increase the productivity of everyone? Anything that can be automated is trivial.
    - Find a bottleneck and can we do better?

## Modeling and defining a problem
- Why are we doing what we are doing right now?
- What are the costs to fix this?
- What are the possible solutions and what are the possible wins or loses for each solution?
- What is the best way to deliver that solution? What format is it - microservice/platform?
- What metrics do we need to define to track the project's
    - Reliability
    - Engagement
    - Wins / Loses
- Discuss the identified cost vs benefit and justify why we need a new solution.

## Planning milestones
- Breakdown the project into workable task items. Breakdown even further.
- Plan and set milestones by weeks to keep track of the project. Share with others for them to follow and know what to expect.
- Define *costs* and esitimate the costs. Plan a sustainable stream of work.
- Scale up the project by distributing work items to your colleagues. 
    - Thank them for their hard work and genuinely congratulate on their accomplishments.

## Execute, get support, give support and repeat
- Get the prototype out fast.
- Execute quickly and be proactively.
    - Get help from your colleagues when blocked and vice versa. Improve documentations along the way.
    - Setting up a weekly round up to identify blockers helps.

## Documentation goes a long way
- Document everything and share within the team and org. Save everyone's time.

## Keep everyone updated
### **Why communicating is important**

Communicating often and efficiently is important because this is the only way to remove risks early on in the project. Especially in a large scoped one with multiple teams working on it, there should be miminum bottlenecks for parallelizing all the work.

For instance,

1. Your manager can request or allocate more resource to you. He/she can unblock you by helping out with XFN alignment. Adjusting expectations and delivery timeline is crucial to giving everyone a chance to repriortize.
2. Other engineers with different contexts can identify risks that you haven't noticed. You don't want to turn back and rewrite the entire stack just because it's missing a piece of logic that you weren't aware of. Leverage that collective intelligence.
3. More of your teammates will understand what you are doing. Having a larger surface area to answer questions from other team's engineers can unblock them faster.

## Gathering data, metrics
- When the project is being released, gather logs and metrics to define clear wins, uncertainties, and loses. 
- Provide numbers.
