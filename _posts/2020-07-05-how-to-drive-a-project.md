title: "How To Drive a Project - Cheat Sheet"
---


July 6th marks the final day of my first full half at Facebook. I drove multiple projects this half and luckly some turned out to have very positive impacts on my team's product. Over the last 6 months, I have accomplished and learned more than I ever did in my life. Along the way I was starting to see a pattern in the endeavors that I deem successful. All successful projects I've done or witnessed shared similarities in how they were found, how they were defined, how they were implemented and how they were driven to the end. To serve my memory in the future and to organize all the floating pieces of realizations, I thought it would be the best if I write it out and articulate with bullet points. So here it goes. This is my version of driving a successful project.

# Project Management Cheat Sheet (Ver 0.1)

## Identifying a problem

- Find needs within the team or the org. 
    - How can I increase the productivity of everyone? How can people not waste time doing trivial stuff? *Anything that can be automated is trivial*.
    - Find a bottleneck. Will our current solution handle 100x the current traffic? Do we own a part of a code that is crucial to our product's performance and reliability? Most importantly, can we provide more efficient/scalable/secure solution to replace the current one?

## Modeling and defining a problem
- Why are we doing what we are doing right now?
- What are the costs to fix this?
- What are the possible solutions and what are the possible wins or loses for each solution?
- Can we microservice-fy / productify the solution to be leveraged by a different product if possible?
- What metrics do we need to define to track the project's
    - Reliability
    - Engagement
    - Wins / Loses
- Let the leadership know. Discuss the cost and justify the project. Have them onboard and hold them accountable for their support. Is the project worth the cost?


## Planning milestones
- Breakdown the project into workable task items.
- Plan and set milestones by weeks to keep track of the project. Share with others for them to follow and know what to expect.
- Define *costs* and esitimate the costs. When planning, give yourself a managable workload. Avoid burnout.
- Scale up the project by distributing work items to your colleagues. Thank them for their work and applaud their accomplishments.


## Execute, get support, give support and repeat
- Get the prototype out there fast. Demo it to those involved in your project. Prove them it works; it's better than the status quo; and that it's worth the cost.
- Execute fast and be proactive.
    - Remove blockers fast and get help from your colleagues. They are here to help. But do not nag them with redundant or trivial questions. Ask about product behaviors or hacks that are not documented or poorly documented. Improve documentations along the way. Save others' times. They don't need to go through the same pain as you did.
    - Check in on your colleagues and provide support when they need one. Make sure that everyone is unblocked ASAP. Setting up a weekly meeting to identify blockers helps.


## Documentation goes a long way
- Keep the number of unecessary meetings to the bare minimum. Document everything and share within the team and org. You won't be pestored by trivial questions and others won't need to waste time being blocked by trivial issues.


## Keep everyone updated
- Keep everyone engaged and updated on the status of the project. When you need their help they need to know the status of the project. Setting up a weekly meeting helps.
- The leadership and colleagues are working on many projects including yours. Actively keep them posted and maintain a clean documentation.

## Gathering data, metrics
- When the project is being rolled out, gather logs and metrics to define clear wins, uncertainties, and loses. Without numbers all the work you've done might as well be meaningless. 
- Wins gives you applauds; uncertainties and loses will give you work items to improve your product further.
