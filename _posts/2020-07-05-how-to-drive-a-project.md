# How To Drive A Project

July 6th marks the final day of my first full half at Facebook. I drove multiple projects this half and luckly some turned out to have very positive impacts on my team's product. Outside of work, I was able to launch my own automated trading system - which I am very proud of. Over the last 6 months, I have accomplished and learned more than I ever did; and I was starting to see a pattern in my endeavors that I deem 'successful'. All my successful projects had a lot of common workflows - how they were founded, how they were defined, how they were implemented and how they were ended. To serve my memory in the future and better define the floating learnings in my head, I thought it would be the best if I sit down and write it out.

## Project Management Cheat Sheet (Ver 0.1)

### Identifying a problem

- Find needs within the team or the org.
- Find a bottleneck or a challenge the team's facing. What can we do better


### Modeling and Defining a problem
- Why are we doing this or not doing this?
- What are the costs
- What possible solutions are there and what are possible wins or loses
- Microservice-fy, productify the needs
- Define metrics to track product's
    - Reliability
    - Engagement
    - Wins / Loses
- Let the leadership know to justify and discuss the cost. Is it worth the cost and the risk?


### Planning, Setting Milestones
- Scale up the project. Plan and set milestones by week to keep track of the project. Serves as a todo list for you and a status board for the leaderships to follow.
- Define costs and practice estimating the engineering costs


### Execute, Get support, Give support
- Get your prototype out there fast. Demo to the actors interested in your product / solution. Prove them it works; it's better than the status quo; and that it's worth the cost we have to put in.
- Execute fast and be proactive.
- Remove blockers fast and get help from people. They are there to help. But do not nag them with redundant or trivial questions. Ask about product behaviors or hacks that are not documented or poorly documented.
- Check in on your colleagues and provide support if they need one. Make sure that everyone is unblocked ASAP.


### Documentation Goes a Long Way
- Don't waste your colleagues' time with unecessary meetings. Document everything and share it within the team or org so you help everyone. You won't be pestored by trivial questions and they won't need to waste time asking trivial questions.

### Keep Everyone Updated
- Keep everyone engaged and updated on the status of the project. If you need their help they need to know where the project is at. The leadership oversees so many projects including yours. Actively keep them posted and maintain a clean documentation.

### Gathering data, metrics
- When the project is being rolled out, gather logs and metrics to define clear wins, uncertainties, and loses. Wins gives you applaud while uncertainties and loses will give you work items to improve your product further.
