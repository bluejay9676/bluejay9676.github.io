# **Driving a Project**

I like to think that the slogans Facebook threw at me aren't some bs gibberish, instead very condensed advice that is based on the "behavior" of a strong engineer. Because all strong engineers and leaders I've encountered during my time at Facebook live by the slogan whether they consciously do it or not. Let me elaborate.

## *Focus on Impact*

It's easier to grasp the idea if you imagine yourself as the owner of a product with real clients. As the owner, you wouldn't want your product to crash or slow down. Users obviously would leave if their experience is bad. Once they leave, it's harder to bring them back then onboard them for the first time. Your product needs to be reliable, scaled, and support all the users' needs. The development cycle should be painless - fast, automated, and foolproof. Otherwise, you are losing users - money!

Think of an ideal state of the product based on the concerns you have and where the product is now. Once you've identified where the gaps are, tackle them. 

For example :

1. Dev process is slow, it should be 1-click from push to deploy → Create a fast e2e code deployment.

2. Prod breaks too often → Enforce unit tests and e2e tests!

3. User experience is bad due to slow and laggy products → Scale the backend!

4. I want to check real-time metrics to quickly address any issues! → Create a real-time dashboard to track metrics easily and set up an alert system.

## *Move Fast && Nothing at Facebook is Somebody Else's Problem*

The meme slogan. Delivering a reliable and scalable product fast has prerequisites. In order to deliver fast, you first need to execute well. Executing well means you :

1. Understand the whole stack end-to-end. This helps you identify where the issue is fast if it were to ever occur. When scaling up, you already know where the bottleneck is.
    - For this reason, it is worth looking underneath the multiple layers of abstractions. You need to have a full picture.
2. Proactively unblock yourself ; unblock your colleagues
    - Everyone at the company is here with a common objective to improve things and ship good products. Help them out and ask for help as well. All the work everyone is doing is to fulfil one grand mission - connect everyone and bring the world closer. In other words, their work is yours and your work is also theirs. That's why nothing at Facebook is somebody else's problem.
